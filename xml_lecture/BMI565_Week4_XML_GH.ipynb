    "# XML Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "><b>XML</b> stands for E<u>x</u>tensible <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage, and is a set of rules for encoding documents in a machine-readable format. In bioinformatics, XML is a commonly used format for sharing heterogenous data (as opposed to delimited files, where every record (row) contains the same data elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) oversaw XML development in 1996.\n",
    "\n",
    "### XML Design Goals:\n",
    "1. XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet\n",
    "2. XML shall support a wide variety of applications\n",
    "3. XML shall be compatible with Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)\n",
    "4. It shall be easy to write programs that process XML documents\n",
    "5. The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the absolute minimum\n",
    "6. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear\n",
    "7. The XML design should be prepared quickly\n",
    "8. The design of XML shall be formal and concise\n",
    "9. XML documents shall be easy to create\n",
    "10. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why can't we use CSV formats?\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually can, but...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CSV files are not always human readable (other documentation is often necessary to identify data elements)\n",
    "2. Inconsistencies are more likely \n",
    "3. CSV files don't easily support multiple levels of data\n",
    "4. CSV files don't easily support addition details such as formatting or meta data (experimental protocols, etc.)\n"

    "\n",
    "#### XML Document Body\n",

    "To open the developer's console in firefox, press Ctrl+Shift+K in Windows or Cmd+Opt+K in OSX. The network tab will allow you to see what information is being sent when, while the Inspector tab allows you to hover over code and see what element of the page it represents. \n",

    "Chrome's developer console can be accessed with Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows or Cmd+Opt+J on OSX. While the tabs are named slightly differently, the functions are essentially the same. Notably, Chrome provides native support for web scraping, though the data it gives are usually oriented more toward the organization of entire sites and less toward acquiring data from an individual page.\n",

    "Before scraping a site, it is worth taking a couple of things into account in order to make sure that you are a good citizen of the web.  The robots.txt file located in the root directory of most websites will usually give you an idea of which directories are and are not allowed for web scraping. It is good practice if you are scraping a large amount of data to make sure that you adhere to the areas that are described by robots.txt with the \"Allow:\" tag. \n",
